## Intentions

To learn unfamiliar technologies with a reasonably sized project.

Specifically...

* Frontend
  * Relay
  * Tailwind CSS
  * Zustand
* Backend
  * TypeGraphQL
  * class-validator
  * MikroORM

The project has additional areas of opportunity, but has provided me sufficient
exposure to the technologies of interest for now.
